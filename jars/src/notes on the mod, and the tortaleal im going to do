ok, so in this, i have a few objectives:
first, I need to exsplain how to create a commodity. I will do this in this order:
the sprite (max 100/100px, transparent background)
then CSV file
    -how to create it
    -what each and every one of the parameters do, and examples.
    -(show image of it in game with no description)
then the description file:
    -how to create it.
    -what each and every one of the parameters do
    -(show image of it in game with description)
from there, how the commodity is created
    -ways to create:
        1) with a bit of code coped from market retrofits.
        2) with code.
        3) (learn how to do this first) how to add it to loot tables as a item.

now i will move onto the advanced things, in the following order:
how to add text with parameters to your item.
    -show examples of basic text with highlights.
    -show example the F1 extra text system, and how to use it.


(this might be a different tutorial)
now i will move onto 'special' items. i will attempt to cover:
1) the CSV file.
2) the class it overwrites, as well as what every single function does.
3) how to handle special item memory


next, i will cover crew replacer. i will start with a branch of this mod, so people can follow along. I will cover the folling in this tortoreal
talk about the basics of what crew replacer does, and how it works.
    -mention crew replacer basic functionality.
    -mention that crew replacer's name is a relec from the past, that i keep because of nalstoga, that it should be called 'commodity_replacer', as it works for all commodity's.
    -talk about what im going to teach today (very breath overview.)
talk about the fact that you will need this mod as a libary to make it work.
    -also mention how one can do crew replacer things, but only if it is enabled.
the basics of crewReplacer_Main, and how to access a job.
    -just the basics. like how load order does not matter, and how you should -always- get your job though crewReplacer_Main.
talk about when its OK to add a crew to a job.
    -talk about how you should do it in 'on application load'
    -talk about how if you absolutely need to add a crew not in this stage, you need to run 'job.organize priority' or risk the game breaking.
the most basic way to create a crew.
    -talk about the crew stats (attack,defence,priority) and what they do.
    -first with adding a crew to one job (raiding) (also mentiining how, if this is all you want to do, you are done), then multiple(raiding, steal a starship, maybe salvaging (as heavy machinery, to show that its not just 'crew', but commodity)).
    -give one of the crew different stats from the rest of them(steal a starship)
the most basic way to add a crew to a crew set
    -showing how mush easier it is, then adding something to everything. (adding the crew to marines)
    -talking about how this works for modded items. (use nexerlin invasions as a example)
    -talking about the fact its going to override some things (steal a starship)
    -mention, that if you add something to a crewReplacer_crewSet after application load, it will not be added.
    -mention, how if you absolutely need to, how you can run this function yourself to load a crest.
    -mention, that if you do this, you -need- to run 'job.organizePrirotiy'
explain the 'priority system'
    -talk about how i can avoid overwriting something with the priority system (showing it with forcing the 'stell a starship' crew to load over the crewset.)
    -talk about what gets priority when.
explain the 'blacklist system'
    -talk about how i can make it so my 'crew' does not count as a certain job with this system (example: steel  starship)
    -talk about how this will prevent crew from being added to this job / crewSet unless said crew has a higher priority
    -say this is the end of the basic tutorial for adding 'crew', and that from now on, i will be talking about advanced topics, for people that want something... more.

Custom crew replacer crew
talk about what this means
    -talk about how one can override certain functions in a 'crew' to achieve certain results' (examples: a crew that can change power, a ship or hull-mod counting as a crew, or even a type of crew that resits losses, so long as a another commodity is in storage.)
    -talk about how crewReplacer has protections to prevent crashes caused by this method, and that crew replacer will always display logs if it fails to do something
talk about the crew functions, and how they connect
    -talk about each of the main 'stat' functions (getPower, getDefence, getAvailable, ext)
    -talk about the 'apply losses' and 'crew used' function (is crew used a function in crew??)
    -talk about the main 'display' functions (display losses, display available, get display name ext)
    -talk about what the crew 'name' means in this situation
show some examples of 'custom' crew:
    1) show in detail, how to change power dynamically.
    2) show in detail how to make a starship of hullmod count as crew
        -show how to get power, and quantity of crew, and what one to use when.
        -show how to display available, and how to display losses.
        -show how to round what crew and get the desired number of ships used.
        -show how to apply losses (with combat readiness losses.)
    3) show in detail how to make a crew resist losses so long as another 'commodity' is in storge.
        -explain how crewUsed and getCrewLost work together.
        -show me changing what commodity are removed when i lose crew.
        -show how to change the display to reflect what was actually lost

mention that this is the end of talking about how crews work, and that now its about adding crew job support.
    -talk about how i only showed a few examples, and that crews are built so you can do -anything- with them
explain how there is 2 ways to add compatibility, by requiring crewReplacer, or only when crewReplacer is detected.
    -talk about the fact that there is 2 ways to handle crew replacer. and mention each.
    I will have to show an example. i think this should be latter in the tutorial.
talk about identifying what you should replace with a crewReplacer_Job, and I need a break
talk about setting up a crewReplacer_Job.
    mention how load order does not matter for crewReplacer_Job's and how its just a collection of data.
    talk about how what you want to do here, is add the first crew to your job.
    mention how you should always add a crewSet named by the commodity of your mod.
    mention, how it can be wize if yuo are doing a lot fo things with the same commodity, to have your own crewSets for you mod, and the advantages of that.
