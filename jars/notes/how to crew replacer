[spoiler=a basic rundown of crew replacer, some common misconceptions and its limits]
[spoiler=why its called crew replacer at all]
the name 'crew replacer' is a kind of relic. when i was first developing this library, my only objective was to create a kind of 'substrate' for crew in certain tasks (like salvaging).
however i quickly realized that 'crew replacer' could be used to change any other commodity in a given task just as easily as 'crew'. so i did it.
so ya. crew replacer is not just for crew. its for every commodity in every event i can edit.
a more appropriate name now in days would be 'commodity task manager' or something, but i quite like crew replacer. so im keeping the name.

[spoiler=what a 'crew' is in this context]
a 'crew' in 'crew replacer' does not reference a normal in game 'crew'. it references the 'crewReplacer_Crew' class, wish acts as a representation of a commodity or something else in a 'job'.
a 'crew' has 'stats' built into the class that can be used to determine a 'crew's losses, ability to do things, and the order a 'crew' is used in.
every one of a 'crew's functions are also built to be overridden by modders, allowing for a 'crew' to represent something that's not a commodity, although with some effort (see the 'advanced' section in 'how to add a crew to crew replacer')
[/spoiler]
[spoiler=what is a 'job' in this context]
a 'job' in crew replacer refers to the 'crewReplacer_Job' class. wish acts as a data storage and management for 'crew'. a 'job' generally replaces instances of a single commodity in single task.
this means that in cases were 2 different 'tasks' share a commodity that 'crew replacer' replaces, there will be 2 different 'job's. one for each commodity (sxample: surveying takes crew. salvaging takes crew. there is 2 'job's one named 'survey_crew' and one named 'survey_crew'. they don't share data at all)
if you want to add a 'crew' to every instance of a commodity crew replacer replaces, you will need to use a 'crew set'. this will be covered in the 'basic' section of 'how to add a crew to crew replacer'
a 'job's functions can be overwritten by modders the same way a 'crew's can. but be careful when you do so, as some of the functions are quite fragile. we will discuss this farther in the 'advanced' section of 'how to add a job to crew replacer, and why you would do it'
[/spoiler]
[spoiler=what is a 'task' in this context]
a 'task' in crew replacer, does not refers to any class or code. rather, it refers to any set of 'job's that all act on the same event.
for example, the 'jobs' 'salvage_crew', and 'salvage_heavyMachinery' both are for salvaging. so the 'task' of 'salvaging' is both of said jobs.

so lets start with the basics: what is a 'crew', 'crew set', and 'job' in the context of crew replacer.
if you are overwhelmed here, don't worry. i will show you examples of everything i talk about in different sections, for your convenience
also, keep in mind that if you want to know more, i keep a updated documentation of my mod [url=https://github.com/Alaricdragon/Crew_Replacer/tree/master/jars/src/desing/documentation]here[/url]

crew:
[spoiler]
a 'crew' in crew replacer represents any class that is, or extends the 'crewReplacer_Crew' class.
most of the time, this something will be a simple commodity. although with some effort you can override functions to dramatically change what a 'crew' is. but we can talk about that latter.
something to clear up: dispute its name, a 'crew' does not have to be a crew or marine, but rather represents a commodity. AKA almost any item in the game that is not a blueprint or installed on a ship.
you can view the documentation for 'crew' [url=https://github.com/Alaricdragon/Crew_Replacer/blob/master/jars/src/desing/documentation/classes/crewReplacer_Crew]here[/url]

job:
[spoiler]
a 'job' in the context of crew replacer is just a list of crews that can do a certain thing. its mush more then just that of course, but for the context of managing 'crew', that's all you need to understand about it
a job is formed out of 4 variables
